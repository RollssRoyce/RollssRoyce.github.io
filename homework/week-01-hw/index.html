        I have a knack for seeing the <i>special </i>in people and connecting them with others like them selves 
      </p>

      <p id="one">
        I created this page because my endless digital circles  need a way to come together. I'm creating an internet hub where all the things that Iâ€™ve done, am doing, and want to do can live. 
      </p>

      <p id="two">
        I don't want this place to be about me that would suck. I'm putting it all out here on the web rather than my diary because I want to work with you. 

      <p id="three">
        you see peeps I'm all about the connections
